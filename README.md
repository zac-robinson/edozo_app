## Running The App

To run the app use `yarn start` or `npm start`
The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or whatever `Local` address is shown in your terminal.

## Running the Tests

To run the test use `yarn test` or `npm test`.
This should run all the tests in the application.

## Extensions

If I was to continue working on this application, I would want to look at expanding the test coverage, making the app styling more responsive and improving error handling as the main points.

Functionally I would look to change the units of measurements and look to hook into more of the weather APIs to show more data or data in different forms.
